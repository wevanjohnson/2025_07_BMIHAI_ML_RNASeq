## Nucleic Acid Extraction + Processing

\Large
femto to picograms of input material

Each cell is:

  - Assigned a unique DNA barcode
  - Optionally treated with UMIs
  - Amplified by one of:
    - Reverse transcriptase (RNA)
    - Multiple displacement amplification (DNA)
    - In vitro transcription (RNA)


## Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)

\Large
- Low input material may cause amplification bias
- UMIs are sequences that correspond to one fragment 
- Sequenced reads with the same UMI are from the same fragment
- Unique sequences collapsed/deduplicated for counting

## Sequencing Library Prep and Sequencing

\Large
- Previous protocols typically include sequencing primers
- Sequencing depth = (# of cells) x (required depth):
  - RNA - 50k paired end reads / cell for cell type classification
  - RNA - .25M-1M paired reads / cell for transcriptome coverage
  - DNA - 30-100x per cell
- e.g. 1000 cell scRNA-Seq = 250M-1B reads per sample!
- Sequences in one PE fastq file are entirely barcodes
- Read length > 50bp for annotated genome
- Single cell sequencing is still *very expensive*

## Sequence QC
\Large
One sample is 100s or 1000s of cells

  * i.e. ~1,000 fastq files per sample
  * May or may not be already demultiplexed by core

UMI-Tools - open source UMI software

Normal fastq processing and QC:

  * Adapter and quality trimming
  * fastqc, multiqc


## Alignment and Quantification
\Large
STAR+htseq-count, kallisto, salmon, CellRanger

Each sample has a different # of cells

Each cell has the same number of measurements (e.g. genes)
= (# of samples) x (# of cells) x (# of genes)

Sparse: most will be zero!

## The Counts Matrix

\Large
- Counts matrix contains either:
  - Read counts or
  - UMI counts if used
- Each cell has:
  - Total number of counts (col. sum, “library size”)
  - Number of non-zero genes
- Each gene has:
  - number of non-zero cells
  - Non-zero mean/variance
- Matrix is sparse: many zeros
- Zeros may be:
  - Cell lacks gene
  - A “drop-out”: gene present but was missed by qPCR

## The Counts Matrix
\center
![](figs/counts.png){height=70%}

## Cell Quality Control

\Large
- Consider metrics jointly and threshold by outliers in distribution
- Most common cell QC metrics are:
  - Count depth
  - Number of genes
  - Fraction of mitochondrial genes


## Cell Quality Control
\center
![](figs/qc.png){height=70%}


## Cell QC metrics should be considered together
\Large
**Example 1:**

Cell with high % of MT genes may represent:

- Cell subtypes highly engaged in respiratory processes (muscle, fat, etc.)
- Broken cells where the cytoplasmic mRNA has escaped, leaving only the MT RNA
- Cell with low count depth, few genes, and high % of MT genes may be a better marker of true “broken” cell events

## Cell QC metrics should be considered together
\Large
**Example 2:**

Cell with abnormally high count depth and large amount of genes may represent: 

- Doublets (droplets or events containing multiple cells)
- Larger cells (cell size can correlate with counts)
- Newly developed tools specifically handle doublets and attempt to resolve these cases (Scrublet, Doublet Finder, etc)

## Cell QC metrics should be considered together
\Large
**Example 3:**

Cell with low counts and low amount of genes may represent:

- “Empty” droplets or events
- Quiescent cell populations


## Additional QC Checks

\Large
- Remove genes that are only expressed in a few cells
  - This naturally sets a limit on the size of cell clusters you can recover
  - i.e. Removing genes expressed in fewer than 20 cells will make it difficult to detect clusters smaller than this
- Account for ambient gene expression (contaminating mRNA from lysed cells prior to library construction)

## Filtering Cells and Genes

\Large
Many measurements

- e.g. 30k genes x 1ks of cells

Some cells are uninformative, e.g.:

- Very few reads, few genes detected
- Two cells sequenced together (i.e. doublets)

Some genes are uninformative:

- Low # reads, low variance across all cells
- Too few cells express gene (e.g. < 10 of 10,000 cells nonzero)

Must filter genes _and_ cells to reduce noise

## Filtering the Counts Matrix

\Large
Cells might also be filtered:

- Very few or zero counts (cell4)
  - Empty well?
  - Ambient expression?
  - Quiescent cell?
- Very many counts (cell5)
  - Possible “doublet” of same cell type
- Inconsistent expression pattern (cellM)
  - Possible “doublet” of different cell types

Doublet: two cells with same cell barcode
